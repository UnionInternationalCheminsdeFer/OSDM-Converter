</head>

<h1>Format considerations</h1>

<p>
<ul>
The IRS 10108.1 is not clear on code tables to be used and in some parts contardictory as the ASC-II 
character set is 
required but at the same time some elements sould contain special characters. The files created will 
apply charactersets for byte size encoding. Usually 
these will be the default character sets of the country. Except for data elements where special characters are 
indicated in 10108.1 all elements will be transliterated to ASC-II.

</ul>
</p>



<h1>Unsupported 108 features</h1>

<p><ul>
The 108 files created from OSDM data should provide the basic features of the specification 10108.1. 
Some features on 10108.1 are dealing with data management can not be supported as they are not needed and 
implemented in OSDM.
<br/><br/>

The OSDM data delivery policy is always to deliver the entire data set and not to indicate data changes. 
Therefore all flags indicating deletions or 
changes are not used. The 108 data will only include valid data and the flags are set to <b>new</b></b>

</ul>
</p>


<h2>TCV file</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>indications on amendments for flags are not provided</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>TCVP file</h2>

<p>

<li>fares are provided as they are defined in OSDM. Additional rounding as described in 10108.1 is not applied.</li>
<li>discount is not supported</li>
<li>number of children is not supported, only adult fares</li>
<li>replaced fare table is not supported</li>
<li>version number is always 1</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>TCVG file</h2>

<p>
Station data are exchanged via MERITS. The OSDM data include only a limited set on station names as 
these are currently not part of MERITS data.

<li>old railway code is not supported</li>
<li>zone code is not supported</li>
<li>pictogram codes are not supported</li>
<li>fonts are not supported</li>
<li>designation for third party is not supported</li>
<li>accounting station code is not supported</li>
<li>geo-coordinates are supported for real stations only and contain the coordinates of MERITS. The 
standard WGS84 system is used as in MERITS, not the outdated Gauss-Krüger system.</li>
<li>version number is always 1</li>
<li>names of virtual border stations are constructed from real station names. There is no guarantee 
that border station names of two 
carriers are identical, the name must not be used to validate a connection of two series.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>TCVS file</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>connecting codes are not supported</li>
<li>route number is provided as unique number but does not indicate a preference</li>
<li>product code is not supported</li>
<li>product offer code is not supported</li>
<li>indication of usual route is not supported</li>
<li>fare calculation will always be route based</li>
<li>ferry link is not supported</li>
<li>replaced series are not supported</li>
<li>abridging code will always be 0 as only necessary via stations are included in OSDM</li>
<li>version number is always 1</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Price Table</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>distance based price table will not be used</li>
<li>no support for flags</li>
<li>the data version is always 1</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>TCVM file</h2>

<p>
<ul>
