<h2>Conversion data</h2> 

<ul>
<p>
The data of 108.1 are not sufficient to provide a complete set of 90918-10 fare data. The missing data 
need to be added in the parameter section of the data set.<br/>

<p>The missing data are added in the conversion parameter section as fare templates which serve as a copy template to 
create 90918-10 fares from the imported data. Missing data can be added to the template using the editing features. 
The template provides a factor to derive the fare price from the standard adult price provided in the 108.1 data. <br/>
</p>
<p>
Form the fare of one series in 108.1 two fares per template are created for the two travel directions. For different travel classes separate templates need to be defined and the 
service class needs to be set in the fare template.<br/></p>
<p>Series listed in TCVL car be attributed a separated combination constraint in the fare template.<br/></p>

<p>The station codes in 108.1 have been misused to other concepts like non-Merits-stations, border points, 
fare reference stations and service brands. These codes need to be mapped to the appropriate entities. For this 
mappings can be defined in the conversion parameter area to map these codes o the proper entities.<br/>
Border points can not be converted directly, so the needed border points will be converted into connection points and border point mappings 
but the station sets of the connection points might be incomplete and must be completed manually and the conversion needs to be started again.<br/>

	In case the service constraint should be added to the route the legacy code of the 108 station must be added in the service constraint only, a mapping entry in this list is not needed.
    To allow a conversion back into 108 data structures the 5 digit station code must be added in the service constraint as legacy code.

<p>
<ul>
Service Constraints can be added via the following options:<br/><br/>

<ul>
<li>Define a mapping for the bus and ferry flag to service constraints in the fare template. 
The service constraint will be applied to the entire fare. </li>
<li>Define a station to service constraint mapping in the station to service constraint mapping in the conversion parameter. The service constraint will be added to the entire fare. 
</li>
<li>Define a service constraint and set the legacy station code in the service constraint. 
The service constraint will be added in the routes of the regional validity at the position of the legacy station. It is recommended to define a text with a short name in the service constraint.

<br/><br/>
Data structures for after sales rules and legacy accounting identifiers can be added to the fare template via the context menu (add child...). <br/>

The legacy accounting identifiers are not needed for conversion but can be used to set an tariff id per fare template to be used in the accounting. If the accounting identifier is missing the ids will be allocated automatically.
<br/>

The after sales templates should be added to define after sales rules. The rules can provide a factor to calculate the fee depending on the rule. The fee is calculated from the price of the fare multiplied by the fee factor and rounded to Euro-Cent.

<h2>Fare data 90918-10</h2> 

<p>
		<ul>The fare data in the fare data section correspond exactly to the data
		 specified within the IRS 90918-10 for the bulk data delivery, Data Ids to link the different data parts within the json export 
		 will be created automatically before the export of the data.<br/><br/>
		 
		The data structure contains the complete set of defined data and is not restricted to data used in the conversion. 
		Additional data might be added manually. Data that are also generated include a data source tag indicating whether it was 
		created by conversion or by import or manually. All data marked as created by conversion will be replaced with the next conversion.
