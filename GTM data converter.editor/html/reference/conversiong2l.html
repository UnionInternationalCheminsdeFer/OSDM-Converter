<h2>Conversion</h2>

<p><ul><img src="../images/convertToLegacy.png" alt="convert"/>Convert the data.<br/></ul></p>

<p><ul>
Conversion has the following steps:

<ul>
	<li>Convert stations into legacy stations</li>
	<li>Convert fare station sets into legacy stations and assign the fare station set code to the included stations - in case a station belongs to multiple fare reference set only on code can be used in the legacy data.</li>
	<li>select convertable fares<br/>
		<ul>
			<li>only fares with service classes B or D are converted</li>
			<li>only fares with a regional validity in one direction is used (using the one with the lower departure station code in case of transit and station-station series)</li>
			<li>only fares that indicate conversion allowed</li>
			<li>only ADULT fares</li>
			<li>only fares without reduction constraints</li>
			<li>only fares with a simple sales availability (from-to-date)</li>		
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Convert each selected fare to one series and one route fare
	<br/><br/>
			<ul>
			<li>convert the regional constraint into a series<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>regional validity must one and only one route description, no zone, no polygon - otherwise there is no conversion </li>
					<li>regional validity must have not more than 5 via stations between departure and arrival - otherwise there is no conversion </li>									
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>convert the price into a route fare - merge the prices from service class B and D into one route fare</li>
			<li>depending on the conversion parameters the fare description for the fare tables are added.</li>					
			<li>create TCVL entry for series of fares with combination model SEPARATE_TICKET</li>		
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>adjust series number in case no legacy accounting codes were available</li>	
	<li>replace old conversion results by the new ones </li>
</ul>

</ul></p>

<h2>Export to legacy files</h2>

<p><ul>
The export creates the TCV files and exports the legacy data from the conversion. 
<br/><br/>
The length of data elements in the legacy might exceed the fixed size of the legay text files.
In this case the element will be truncated and an error displayed in the console view.

<br/><br/>
<ul>
			<li>Legacy Series - converted from OSDM regional validity - export to TCVS </li>
			<li>Legacy Separate Contract Series - converted from OSDM fulfillment constraint - export to TCVL</li>
			<li>Legacy Distance Fares - not used</li>
			<li>Legacy Route Fares - converted from OSDM regional validity - export to TCV price table</li>
			<li>Legacy Stations - - converted from OSDM station details an service constraint legacy codes - export to TCVG</li>
			<li>Legacy Fare descriptions - converted from fare text - export to TCVP</li> 
			<li>Legacy Memos - converted from fare detail description - export to TCVM</li>
		<br/><br/>
</ul>
