<h1>What's new with OSDM 1.4</h1>

<h2>Import and Export of OSDM data</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<p>The Export of data to the OSDM format supports the version 1.2 and 1.4. 
The version can be selected in the Delivery data.</p>
<p>The import of OSDM data supports the versions 1.2 and 1.4. The internal representations is aligned to OSDM version 1.4.</p>

</ul>
<p>


<h2>Carrier Constraint in Regional Validity and Route (ViaStation)</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<p>The Regional Validity and the Route (ViaStation Data) has been changed from a 
single carrier to a carrier constraint allowing multiple carriers to be provided. When OSDM data of version 1.2 are 
imported or legacy 108 data are converted a carrier constraint is created containing the single carrier in the list of included carriers.</p>

<p>In the export to the old OSDM version 1.2 only the first carrier of the list will be included in the OSDM data of version 1.2</p>

<p>Additional carriers might be added in the conversion from 108 via a new add carrier rules that can be defined 
in the conversion parameters. For a set of stations a carrier can be added to the main route in case two 
stations of the station list in the rule are part of the regional validity.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Involved TCOs in the Fare</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<p>The list of involved TCOs (Ticket Controlling Organizations) can be added to a fare. </p>

<p>In the export to the old OSDM version 1.2 the list of TCOs will not be included</p>

<p>When data are imported without involved TCOs all carriers included in the Regional Constraint will be added to the list on involved TCOs.
Additional TCOs might be added via a new add carrier rules that can be defined 
in the conversion parameters. For a set of stations a TCO can be added to the fare in case two 
stations of the station list in the rule are part of the regional validity.</p>
