<h1>Stations</h1>

<p><ul>Stations can be imported from the MERITS station data. The data have to be retrieved from the MERITS application.<br/><br/>

Company codes can be imported from an EDIFACT file according to the MERITS standard. The import will take the station code and the 
station name from the data file.<br/><br/>
Stations without country code or with a wrong country code (e.g. not included in  the official UIC country code list) will be ignored. 

</ul>
