<p>
	Stations can be imported from the MERITS station data. The data have to be retrieved from the MERITS
	application.
</p>
<p>
	Company codes can be imported from an EDIFACT file according to the MERITS standard. The import will take the station
	code and the station name from the data file.
</p>
<p>
	Stations without country code or with a wrong country code (e.g. not included in the official UIC country code list)
	will be ignored.
