<h1>Stations</h1>

<p>
	Stations can be imported from the <b>MERITS</b> station data. The data have to be retrieved from the <b>MERITS</b>
	application.
</p>

<p>
	Company codes can be imported from an <b>EDIFACT</b> file according to the <b>MERITS</b> standard. The import will take the station
	code and the station name from the data file.
</p>

<p>
	Stations without country code or with a wrong country code (e.g. not included in the official UIC country code list)
	will be ignored.
