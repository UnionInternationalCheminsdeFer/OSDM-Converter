<h1>Border Points</h1>

<p><ul>
Border point reference data describe the border points in the 108.1 legacy data and provide information to create the new 
connection points used in IRS 90918-10. Border points define the border between two tariff areas.<br/><br/>



Border point reference data can be imported from a csv file with the following columns:<br/><br/>


Border point reference data for a border point will be used for conversion only if the data is complete for both involved carriers!<br/><br/>

Note: These codes are not used for conversion. They are included for a better understanding of the involved codes and the data cleanup at a later stage.</td></tr>

In case the station is directly n the border the station code is identical for side 1^and side 2. In case multiple station codes are needed they are separated by a "/". Multiple codes might be needed in case that three lines from different directions join.</td></tr>
