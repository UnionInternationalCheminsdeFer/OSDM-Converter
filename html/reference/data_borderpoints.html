<h1>Border Points</h1>

<p>
	Border point reference data describe the border points in the <b>108.1</b> legacy data and
	provide information to create the new connection points used in IRS <b>90918-10</b>. Border
	points define the border between two tariff areas.
</p>
<p>
	Border point reference data can be imported from a <b>CSV</b> file with the following
	columns:
</p>
<p>
	Border point reference data for a border point will be used for conversion only if the data is complete for both
	involved carriers.
