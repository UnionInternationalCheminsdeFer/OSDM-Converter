<h3>Conversion has the following steps:</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Convert stations into legacy stations</li>
	<li>Convert fare reference sets into legacy stations and assign the fare reference code to the included stations -
		in case a station belongs to multiple fare reference set only on code can be used in the legacy data.</li>
	<li>Select fares to be converted
		<ul>
			<li>only fares with service classes B and D are converted</li>
			<li>only the fare with a regional validity in one direction is used (using the one with the lower departure
				station code in case of transit and station-station series)</li>
			<li>only fares that indicate conversion allowed</li>
			<li>only <b>ADULT</b> fares</li>
			<li>only fares without reduction constraints</li>
			<li>only fares with a simple sales availability (from-to-date)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Convert each selected fare to one series and one route fare
		<ol>
			<li>Convert the regional constraint into a series
				<ul>
					<li>The regional validity must have one and only one route description, no zone, no polygon - otherwise there is no
						conversion </li>
					<li>The regional validity must have not more than 5 via stations between departure and arrival - otherwise there
						is no conversion </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Convert the price into a route fare - merge the prices from service class B and D into one route fare</li>
			<li>Depending on the conversion parameters the fare description for the fare tables are added.</li>
			<li>Create <b>TCVL</b> entry for series of fares with combination model <b>SEPARATE_TICKET</b></li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>adjust series number in case no legacy accounting codes were available</li>
	<li>replace old conversion results by the new ones </li>
</ol>

<h2>Export to legacy files</h2>

<p>
	The export creates the <b>TCV</b> files and exports the legacy data from the conversion.
</p>

<p>
	The length of data elements in the legacy might exceed the fixed size of the legacy
	text files. 	In this case the element will be truncated and an error displayed in the console view.
