<h1>Data Editing</h1>

<p>
	Data are presented in a tree structure where the basic branches are created automatically. Tree branches can be edited
	by the functions of the context menu on a tree branch to:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>add child data</li>
	<li>add sibling data</li>
	<li>delete data</li>
	<li>copy/paste data</li>
	<li>validate data</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
	The tree leaves can be edited in the properties window which is displayed when a tree branch is selected. Text and
	numeric values can be entered directly, whereas codes are added from listboxes. In case multiple entries are possible
	a multi-select dialog will pop up.<br />
</p>
<p>
	Note: Data objects contained in another object are edited via the context menu (e.g. multi-language text data object
	within the list of texts), whereas references to such a text object are edited as a leave in the property view via a
	selection list. (e.g. referencing a text data object within a fare).</br>
