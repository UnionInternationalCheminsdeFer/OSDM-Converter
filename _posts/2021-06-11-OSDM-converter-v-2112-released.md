Converter version 2.1.12

New features:

  - the new filter in the fare template to apply a template to some carriers only. 
This can be used in case a data delivery includes series of multiple carriers and the 
conditions are different. In case the filter list is empty the template applies to all 
series.  


 - support of the route number in the conversion from OSDM to 108 in case there are multiple 
    routes with the same departure and arrival.

 - more detailed output on errors
