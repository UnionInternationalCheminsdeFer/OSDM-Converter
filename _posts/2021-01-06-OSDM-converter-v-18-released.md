New features are added with this release.

New Features:

- connection points are now generated for all routes
- add alternative tree view in the outline window with improved handling of large lists
- additional error messages
- fares related to a regional constraint are now additionally listed within the regional constraint

Bug fix:

- fixed the preference setting to import convertable fares only (Default is on!)
