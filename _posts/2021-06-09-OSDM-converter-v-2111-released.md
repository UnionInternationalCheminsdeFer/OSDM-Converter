Converter version 2.1.11

New features:

  - the new element Base Price Calculation Class in the fare template allows to select explicitly whether 
the first or second class price from the 108 data should be used as a base. E.g. the 
first class price for a dog (ServiceClass B) can be based on the second class price 
of the 108 data. The default value is to use the service class, so there is no need 
to change the data except in case you want to use the new feature.
